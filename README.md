**TabErrans** is a collection of open repositories dedicated to the creation of **digital research infrastructure**.
It is just one drop in an infinite ocean of repositories, but also one more page in the Library of Alexandria.

At present, TabErrans can be understood as a shared workspace for developing **scientific software**, experimental tools, and supporting infrastructure, as well as for facilitating the use and integration of third-party tools. All repositories are released under **GPL-3**, ensuring openness, transparency, and the freedom to study, modify, and reuse the work.

This is not a product, a startup, or a finished framework.
It is a **table** where people sit, think, build, and learn together.

## What lives here?

* Research-oriented software and prototypes
* Data processing and analysis infrastructure
* Reproducible workflows and technical experiments
* Glue code between existing open tools
* Ideas in motion, not polished products

Some repositories may be stable; others are explicitly exploratory.

## Want a seat at the table?

Fork whatever you need or find useful — GPL-3 allows it.
Reuse, adapt, break, rebuild.

## Feedback and collaboration

Suggestions, corrections, and discussion are always welcome.
The goal is not perfection, but **doing things with “(con)ciencia”** — with awareness, care, and scientific intent — and continuous  learning.
